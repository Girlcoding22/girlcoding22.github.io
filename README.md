# girlcoding22.github.io
This is the main directory for most of the code. The projects are in their own individual folder.
- GioT: the girls who code website
- Portfolio: holds all the assets for my portfolio website, usually where recruiters should check out!
- GWCSLHS: retrying to put all the assets in GioT there because of the better name of the folder.
